# illume 0.0.1.9000

First working version. One engine, `ilm_model()`, fits gaussian, binomial,
Poisson, negative binomial and multinomial models by Laplace approximation via
RTMB, with lme4-style formulas, crossed and nested random intercepts and slopes,
mgcv penalised smooths and AR(1) correlation.

## Features

* `ilm_model()` fits every supported family through one formula interface, so
  the object, the methods and the diagnostics do not change as the model gets
  more complicated.
* Gaussian models with no random or smooth terms report **exact** t and F
  inference agreeing with `lm()` and `car::Anova()`, rather than the
  large-sample approximations used elsewhere.
* `ilm_anova()` gives Type II and Type III analysis of deviance, testing each
  term jointly across all category dimensions, with Wald, likelihood-ratio and
  parametric bootstrap variants.
* Built-in diagnostics (`ilm_appraise()`, `ilm_rqr_test()`, `ilm_check_ar()`)
  state whether each assumption is consistent with the data and name a remedy
  when it is not.
* Reduced-rank (`rr`) category covariances make larger numbers of outcome
  categories tractable.

## Validation

Summary of the simulation studies run against this version on 2026-09-19. Full
tables and per-cell detail are in `studies/findings/`; that material is intended
for the methods paper rather than for this file.

* **Coverage of Wald confidence intervals is nominal** across 11 designs
  spanning five families, AR(1) correlation and deliberately under-powered
  cells: 0.947 to 0.954 against a nominal 0.95, from 2000 replicates per cell.
* **The latent budget governs convergence, not coverage.** Convergence ran
  33% / 58% / 83% / 98% at 1.5 / 3 / 5 / 10 observations per latent value, while
  coverage among converged fits stayed nominal throughout. The approximation
  declines to return an answer rather than returning an overconfident one.
* **Type I error is nominal** for both Wald and likelihood-ratio tests
  (0.045–0.055 at a nominal 0.05), and null p-values are uniform by
  Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, not merely correct at the 5% threshold.
* **Agreement with independent implementations** is at numerical tolerance:
  1e-15 to 7e-5 against lme4, glmmTMB and nnet, and within 0.10 standard errors
  of brms at roughly 82x the speed.
* **Against `mclogit::mblogit()`**, the only other R package fitting
  random-effects multinomial models, illume holds nominal coverage where PQL
  does not: 0.949 versus 0.891 with four observations per cluster, where PQL
  attenuates fixed effects to 73% of their true magnitude. Note that mclogit
  attains a lower RMSE there, since shrinkage trades bias for variance — a
  defensible trade for prediction but not for inference.

Coverage figures in cells with convergence failures are conditional on
convergence: failed fits are excluded, so surviving coverage is optimistic if
failure correlates with extreme estimates.
